   - **Solution**: Standardized to 3 files across all components
   - **Files Updated**: `visitorTrackingService.js`, `FirebaseAuthContext.jsx`

2. **Race Condition Protection** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Problem**: Multiple fingerprint initialization calls could conflict
   - **Solution**: Added initialization promise to prevent race conditions
   - **File Updated**: `fingerprintService.js`

3. **Visitor-to-User Migration** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - **Problem**: No data migration when visitors sign up
   - **Solution**: Added migration logic to transfer visitor upload history
   - **Files Updated**: `FirebaseAuthContext.jsx`, `api.js`

#### Verified Features:
- ✅ Fingerprint-based visitor identification
- ✅ Upload count tracking (3 files max for visitors)
- ✅ Session persistence across browser sessions
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on user authentication
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for fingerprinting failures

### 3. Feature Access Control Testing ✅

**Status: PASSED** - Comprehensive feature gating implemented

#### Subscription Tiers Verified:
- **Visitor**: Basic CSV upload, simple charts (3 files, 2MB each)
- **Free**: Enhanced features, 10 files, 10MB storage
- **Pro**: Advanced charts, exports, 100 files, 100MB storage  
- **Enterprise**: All features, unlimited files and storage

#### Issues Fixed:
1. **Feature Definition Consistency** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Problem**: Enterprise tier referenced undefined FEATURES object
   - **Solution**: Explicitly defined all enterprise features
   - **File Updated**: `featureGating.js`

#### Verified Functionality:
- ✅ Tier-based feature access control
- ✅ Upgrade prompts for premium features
- ✅ File format restrictions by subscription
- ✅ Usage tracking and analytics
- ✅ Storage and upload limits enforcement

### 4. Code Quality & Optimization ✅

**Status: EXCELLENT** - High code quality standards maintained

#### Strengths Identified:
- ✅ **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized with debouncing and caching
- ✅ **Documentation**: Extensive documentation coverage
- ✅ **Security**: Proper input validation and sanitization

#### Minor Improvements Suggested:
- 🔄 Consider TypeScript migration for enhanced type safety
- 🔄 Implement consistent PropTypes validation
- 🔄 Add unit tests for critical authentication logic

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements Implemented

### Authentication Enhancements
```javascript
// Added visitor data migration on user signup
const migrateVisitorDataToUser = async (user) => {
  const visitorData = localStorage.getItem('visitor_upload_data');
  const visitorId = await fingerprintService.getVisitorId();
  
  if (visitorData && visitorId) {
    await authAPI.migrateVisitorData({
      visitorId, visitorData, userId: user.id
    });
    localStorage.removeItem('visitor_upload_data');
  }
};
```

### Race Condition Protection
```javascript
// Added initialization promise to prevent race conditions
async initialize() {
  if (this.initialized) return this.visitorId;
  
  if (this.initializationPromise) {
    return await this.initializationPromise;
  }
  
  this.initializationPromise = this._doInitialize();
  return await this.initializationPromise;
}
```

### Consistency Fixes
```javascript
// Standardized visitor file limits across all components
constructor() {
  this.maxUploadsPerVisitor = 3; // Consistent with backend
  this.maxFileSizeBytes = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB limit
}
```
